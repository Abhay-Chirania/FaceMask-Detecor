# FaceMask-Detecor
During Covid-19 masks have become an important tool . This project detects masks in pictures and can be easily modified to do so in video too. The project contains a Trainer script which is features two models, A custom CNN model and other MobilenetV2 . Any one can be used to train the model on a good dataset. The project also has a predictor script which uses opencv.dnn with resnet model to identify faces in an image, feeds the identified faces through the trained model and gives out a prediction whether face is wearing a mask or not. The project already contains pre-trained model trained for 6 epochs and around 80% accuracy. Feel free to train the model on a better dataset and more epochs for better result.
